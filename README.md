This is ANN i.e., Artificial Neutral Network model that predicts the churn rate of a bank. It will tell whether the person will leave the bank or not using keras & tensor flow backend.

I have uploaded the model (.h5 file), the python code for the model (.py file) as well as the datset(.csv). You can simply clone the git repository and you will have everything necessary to work with the model.
